        <h1>The Name</h1>
        <p>I spent my early childhood living in a blue house on Minto Crescent, Vancouver, Canada. The lazy susan
          that sat in the center of our large, wooden dining table held thousands of delicious dishes throughout the
          years. The kitchen at Minto is where my love for food and cooking began. </p>

        <h1> My Inspiration </h1>
        <p>The kitchen at Minto would hold no special meaning if not for my mother, Jennifer.</p>
        <p>My mother is my biggest inspiration (in all aspects of life, really). Her cooking is a perfect balance of
          deliciousness and nutrition, and her thoughtful meal planning has not only nourished my family for years, but
          also inspired my appreciation for food.</p>
        <p>The flavours that she thoughtfully marries together has taught me a great deal about Taiwanese culture and
          Chinese cooking. I remember visiting Taipei for the first time and being struck by the mosaic of flavours -
          both savoury and sweet - produced from the stoves and kitchens of street carts and restaurants alike.</p>
        <p>Seeing as my mother always cooks without any recipes, I hope this website will serve as a way to preserve her
          amazing dishes. I hope any reader who stumbles upon this website will enjoy her recipes as much as I do.

        <h1> About me </h1>
        <p>Ever since I moved away from Vancouver, I've found that whipping up recipes from my mother's recipe book is
          what makes me feel most at home. I am a novice cook but a big food enthusiast, and I enjoy exploring new
          restaurants and bars wherever I go. </p>
        <p>Born and raised in the multicultural city of Vancouver, Canada, I feel incredibly lucky to have grown up in a
          city with establishments serving up a diverse array of dishes from around the world.</p>
        <p>I am currently a MBA student at Kellogg, and I've relied on my mother's recipes to provide me a comforting
          taste of home while living abroad.</p>
